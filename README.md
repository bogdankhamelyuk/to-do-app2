# ToDoApp2

This is my second ToDo application, which is made using Angular for Frontend and ASP.Net Core + MySql database for Backend. 

## Requirements

* Frontend
  * Angular CLI
* Backend
  * [MySql server](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/): Please note, that product version must be compatible with your OS version.
  * [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
